## Abstract
*I-am-Data* is a digitized self-portrait collage displayed on an HTML-based page. This piece explores identity and expression through various levels of data collection, from self-tracking to passive surveillance. Reflecting on the relationship between the online self and the platforms, interfaces, and applications that help shape it, *I-Am-Data* critiques methods used to categorize and monitor users. By visualizing these dynamics, this self-portrait questions the sense of self when defined by data.

# **Overall Score:** 0/20

>>## 1) Communication, Style, & Polish (0 / 5)

> **a)** Is the written content clear, concise, and does it have a logical flow?
> >The written content of this project is very well thought out and has an organized, logical flow from the summary of the project, contextualization, conception, and reflection on content. The writing not only does a great job at explaining the project and its relevance to our data-driven world, but it also prompts the reader to question their own digital data footprint and how they might be represented in data. I only have one note/suggestion that I think might improve this project, and it's not even a critique. I found the last paragraph of the blog post, in which you reflect on how, even in your "expose" of how we "performatively" represent ourselves online through our data, you also manipulated the data in the self-portrait to represent yourself a certain way, to be the most interesting part. I think you should expand upon this reflection and relate it to the ignorance that many people have towards the risks of data farming. I would say at least expand upon this reflection. I will only give suggestions of how I think it should be expanded, but everything is up to you. That being said, if possible, you should include another reference to an article in this reflection section. I think one about the psychological effects of the internet/online representation and/or one about the future of data security and the threats against it from AI would fit in nicely here

> **b)** Does the author have an engaging writing style which grabs the reader's attention?
> >  The author makes use of a very engaging writing style, and it is obvious that the content was thoughtfully planned out before the writing commenced. As said before, the content on the blog does an excellent job at leading the reader through the various rationales behind the project while also providing academic context to the work and holding the attention of the reader throughout. My only note related to engagement would be that the academic Contextualization paragraphs went on a little too long. If possible, splitting one of, or both, of the larger paragraphs (#3 or #4) into 2 would help emphasize the point being made in each. 
> **c)** Are there any grammar or spelling errors?
