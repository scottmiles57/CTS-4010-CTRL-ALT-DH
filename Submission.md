## Abstract
*I-am-Data* is a digitized self-portrait collage displayed on an HTML-based page. This piece explores identity and expression through various levels of data collection, from self-tracking to passive surveillance. Reflecting on the relationship between the online self and the platforms, interfaces, and applications that help shape it, *I-Am-Data* critiques methods used to categorize and monitor users. By visualizing these dynamics, this self-portrait questions the sense of self when defined by data.

# **Overall Score:** 0/20
--- 
>>## 1) Communication, Style, & Polish (4.5 / 5)

> **a)** Is the written content clear, concise, and does it have a logical flow?
> >The written content of this project is very well thought out and has an organized, logical flow from the summary of the project, contextualization, conception, and reflection on content. The writing not only does a great job at explaining the project and its relevance to our data-driven world, but it also prompts the reader to question their own digital data footprint and how they might be represented in data. I only have one note/suggestion that I think might improve this project, and it's not even a critique. I found the last paragraph of the blog post, in which you reflect on how, even in your "expose" of how we "performatively" represent ourselves online through our data, you also manipulated the data in the self-portrait to represent yourself a certain way, to be the most interesting part. I think you should expand upon this reflection and relate it to the ignorance that many people have towards the risks of data farming. I would say at least expand upon this reflection. I will only give suggestions of how I think it should be expanded, but everything is up to you. That being said, if possible, you should include another reference to an article in this reflection section. I think one about the psychological effects of the internet/online representation and/or one about the future of data security and the threats against it from AI would fit in nicely here

>  - [Data Security and AI Article](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/privacy-ai-era-how-do-we-protect-our-personal-information)

> **b)** Does the author have an engaging writing style which grabs the reader's attention?
> >  The author makes use of a very engaging writing style, and it is obvious that the content was thoughtfully planned out before the writing commenced. As said before, the content on the blog does an excellent job at leading the reader through the various rationales behind the project while also providing academic context to the work and holding the attention of the reader throughout. My only note related to engagement would be that the academic Contextualization paragraphs went on a little too long. If possible, splitting one of, or both, of the larger paragraphs (#3 or #4) into 2 would help emphasize the point being made in each. 

> **c)** Are there any grammar or spelling errors?
>> No noticeable spelling or grammatical errors!  

--- 
>> ## 2) Relevance to Special Issue Theme (5 / 5)

> **a)** Is the submission a good fit for the journal?
> > Yes, this project submission is a great fit for the journal.

> **b)** Does it relate strongly to the issue theme of creativity in digital spaces, or is its connection loose?
> > This project has a really strong connection to the theme and is extremely relevant to important topics included under the journal theme. The self-portrait as a format for a data visualization is an extremely creative way to go about discussing the impact of online identity.

> **c)** Are there other ways that their work connects, which could be further explored?
> > Like I mentioned in section 1, I think expanding upon the reflection section at the end of the blog post and relating it to the topics I linked is a good idea. I am aware that this is the conclusion to the blog post, and it does a great job at wrapping it up, but to replace it, I was thinking that you could directly prompt the readers to consider the types of data available about them and the security of it (I'll leave it up to you).

> **d)** Do you know of any articles or other sources which might be helpful to the author?

>> ## **3) Overall Originality, Creativity, and Strength of Ideas (5 / 5)**

> **a)** Are the ideas unique and compelling?
> > The author's ideas and creativity with the concept of this project are very compelling to the reader. As she points out, the slow scroll and arrangement of the visualization are captivating and urge the viewer to examine the project on a closer level. Additionally, this theme of inspiring personal reflection in the reader is continued in the writing of the project, which indirectly prompts the reader to examine what their own representations through online data might look like. Strengthening this aspect and directly prompting the reader is one of my only critiques of this submission.

> **b)** Does the author offer an original point of view?
> > The author approaches the topic of this project in a very original way that leaves room for interpretation when analyzing the visual and comprehending the writting. 

--- 
>> ## 4) Accuracy and Completion of Markdown Code (0 / 5)

> **a)** Does the Markdown file include metadata, with the title, date, issue, author, citation, tags, abstract, and bio, etc. (see below)?
> > Yes, everything is present.

> **b)** Are the headings properly formatted? Do the links work?
> > Formatting of markdown code is proper, and all links to the blog post or visualization work correctly.
 
> **c)** Are the images properly sized?
> > The Image in the markdown code is too large and should be reduced by at least 50%. However, due to the format of the file, I am not entirely sure if that is possible or not. 

> **d)** If there are citations, are they properly encoded?
> > Citations are all properly formatted and encoded into the markdown file.

# Well Done!!!
